title: Dry Fast Diary Entry #1

I'm dry fasting. That's like.. fasting, but dry.. so no food goes in, but ALSO no liquids go in. 

This is maybe my 4th or 5th dry fast. I'm not a husky guy, so I'm not doing them to lose weight. I've had long-standing gut problems that are greatly helped by the abstention of food and liquids. My longest go at it so far is 60 hours, just shy of three days. 

I started this fast last night at 10:00PM, and I'm looking to go almost 48 hours with it, so I'll be having dinner tomorrow night. 

Best of luck! (to my self! )
