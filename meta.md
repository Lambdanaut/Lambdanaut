I'm Josh! I really don't like talking about myself, so here's a photo of me smiling. Hopefully that will placate your nearly unquenchable desire to know everything you possibly can about me. Why does this page exist, then, you may be wondering? Pure, unadulterated conformity. What would my very personal blog be without a page dedicated solely to myself, with a pretty picture of me smiling in the corner. I'll tell you, better off. 

I'm not all that important. Read my <a href="/archive">blog posts</a>.
